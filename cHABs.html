    <h2> Harmful Cyanobacteria Blooms </h2>
        <p> In freshwater and marine ecosystems, cyanobacteria blooms are common in warmer months and can cause serious threats to human and environmental health. What causes these blooms? How can we detect them? What about preventing them? </p>
    </center>

    <h3>What are cHABs? How are they caused?</h3>
        <p>A harmful cyanobacteria (algal) bloom, also known as cHAB, is the extensive growth of cyanobacteria in aquatic envrionments as a result of high nutrient inputs and excess warmth and sunlight. This growth manifests as desnse mats either on the water's surface or at the bottom of lakes. Blooms are often visible from the surface and can present in a variety of colors. In freshwater systems, the blooms are green or blue. In marine systems, the blooms are red (also referred to as Red Tide) (Wood et al., 2016). </p>

        <p>Under these productive conditions, cyanobacteria can produce a wide range of toxic secondary metabolites, referred to as cyanotoxins. A wide variety of toxins exist that are produced by various taxa. Hence, these toxic compounds can fall under many categories, such as alkaloids, lipidic compounds, or peptides. Though not well understood, it is believed that cyanobacteria produce toxins for a competitive advantage or cellular defense in response to competition from grazing or resource scarcity (Dittman et al., 2013).   </p>

    <h3>Routes and Effects of Cyanotoxin Exposure</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, exposure to cHABs can be fairly common in the summer months. Humans can be exposed to cyanotoxins by recreating on blooming lakes, whether that be direct skin contact with the water, ingestion of the water, or inhalation of aersolized toxins. Given the toxic nature of cHABs, there is a significant human health concern associated with exposure to blooms. A wide variety of cyanotoxins can be produced by blooms, including heptatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, dermatoxins, and irritant toxins. Accute (short-term) exposure to cyanotoxins can result in skin/eye irritation, sore throat, nausea and vomitting, diarrhea, fever, and abdominal pain. Symptoms usually resolve within a few days after acute exposure. Chronic (long-term) exposure to cyanotoxins is much more serious. Since cyanotoxins can take the form of heptatotoxins and neurotoxins, chronic exposure can lead to liver toxicity and neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Alzheimer's (Wood et al., 2016). </p>

    <h3>New Hampshire Case Study</h3>
        <p>In New Hampshire, a cluster of ALS cases surrounding Lake Mascoma was attributed to the occurrence of blooms on that lake (Caller et al., 2009). Researchers identified 9 ALS patients living near the lake, an incidence of ALS that is ~25 times higher than the expected rate. Chronic exposure to the neurotoxin BMAA through contact with blooms or aersolization of the toxin is suspected to be the cause based on toxin assesment in lake water and ALS incidence. Future studies could analzye brain tissue for the presence of cyanotoxins to support Caller et al.'s findings. </p>

    <h3>Bloom Dynamics</h3>
        <p>The strains and population struture of cyanobacteria present in a bloom can alter its dynamics. Sogge et al., 2013, studied a bloom-forming genus called Planktothrix in Norwegian lakes to understand how bloom populations vary across lakes. By analyzing NRPS genes as markers for toxin-production, the researchers found that the different lakes contained a similar structure of Planltothrix variants. They also found low genetic diversity within variants compared to between-variants, verifying the distinctness of the variants. The gene analysis also revealed that new variants resulted from recombination events between Planktothrix variants. From studies like this one, we see the influence of microbial evolution, gene flow, and dispersal mechanisms on microbial population such as cyanobacteria blooms.   </p>

        <p>Quorum sensing is predicted to play an important role in cyanobacteria bloom formation. Blooms are formed when cyanobacteria rapidly grow and aggregate into a surface mat similar to a biofilm. It is predicted that AHLs (acyl-homoseries lactone), signaling molecules that are potentially present in cyanobacteria environments, allow cyamonacterial cells to communicate with each other and form blooms as well as regulate cell growth, metabolism, and other "group behaviors." Some microbes can produce metabolites that block binding sites and prevent quorum sensing from occurring to better compete with other microbes. Hence, a possible way to mitigate blooms is by utilizing artifically produced quenching quorum signaling molecules, proposed by Yan et al., 2023. The study analyzed a signaling molecule in Microcystis, a bloom-forming genus, to determine its ability to prevent the aggregation of Microcystis cells in a toxic bloom. Upon implementation of the signaling molecule FN, Microcystis growht was inhibited and programmed cellular death was even induced. Further analysis concluded that this molecule was successfully blocking the quorum sensing receptor protein. The utilization of FN, which is nontoxic and naturally occurring, could provide a solution to toxic cyanobacteria blooms. <p>
        <p>The figure below from Yan et al., 2023, shows the 3 quorum sensing inhibitors tested in this study. In blue, FN proves to be the most effective and also least toxic molecule, proving to be a potential bloom solution. </p>
