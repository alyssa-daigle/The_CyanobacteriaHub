    <h2> Harmful Cyanobacteria Blooms </h2>
        <p> In freshwater and marine ecosystems, cyanobacteria blooms are common in warmer months and can cause serious threats to human and environmental health. What causes these blooms? How can we detect them? What about preventing them? </p>
    </center>

    <h3>What are cHABs? How are they caused?</h3>
        <p>A harmful cyanobacteria (algal) bloom, also known as cHAB, is the extensive growth of cyanobacteria in aquatic envrionments as a result of high nutrient inputs and excess warmth and sunlight. This growth manifests as desnse mats either on the water's surface or at the bottom of lakes. Blooms are often visible from the surface and can present in a variety of colors. In freshwater systems, the blooms are green or blue. In marine systems, the blooms are red (also referred to as Red Tide). </p>

        <p>Under these productive conditions, cyanobacteria can produce a wide range of toxic secondary metabolites, referred to as cyanotoxins. A wide variety of toxins exist that are produced by various taxa. Hence, these toxic compounds can fall under many categories, such as alkaloids, lipidic compounds, or peptides. Though not well understood, it is believed that cyanobacteria produce toxins for a competitive advantage or cellular defense in response to competition from grazing or resource scarcity.   </p>

    <h3>Effects of Cyanotoxin Exposure</h3>
        <p> Given the toxic nature of cHABs, there is a significant human health concern associated with exposure to blooms. A wide variety of cyanotoxins can be produced by blooms, including heptatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, dermatoxins, and irritant toxins.</p>
