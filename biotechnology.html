        <h2>Cyanobacteria in Biotechnology</h2>
            <p>Cyanobacteria are considered a source of bioactive compounds that could serve many eco-friendly purposes. Abed et al., 2008, review the many potential uses. Read on to find out!</p>

    <h3>Bioremediation</h3>
        <p>Cyanobacteria are capable of removing pollutants from the environment and degradaing them, and thus have been used in bioremediation efforts. With the help of aerobic oligotrophs, cyanobacteria can degrade oil components, surfactancts, and herbicides. Cyanobacteria guide the aerobic oligotrophs in degradation by providing oxygen needed to break down aromatic rings, simple organics, and fixed nitrogen, allowing them to successfully break down pollutants. Cyanobacteria are also useful for treating wastewater by decreasing calcium, chloride, phenol, and melanoidin, creating treated water suitable for the survival of fish and other organisms. </p>  

    <h3>Energy Sources</h3>
        <p>To replace fossil fuel use, cyanobacteria have been harnessed for their ability to produce hydrogen gas as an energy source. Hydrogen is produced typically as a byproduct of nitrogen fixation or growth under nitrogen limited conditions. Over 14 genera of cyanobacteria are known to produce hydrogen gas in several culture conditions. Photobioreactor use has been attempted to harness the hydrogen gas produced by cyanobacteria and has proven to bring down the cost of biologically produced hydrogen.  </p>

    <h3>Biofertilizers</h3>
        <p>With the ability of heterocystous cyanobacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen, fertility of soils can be improved upon inoculating with cyanobacteria. Nitrogen would be added in an organic form rather than through the use of chemical soil fertilizers that are inefficient and runoff into the environment. Cyanobacteria biofertilizer has been shown to increase nitrogen inputs and crop yield.  </p>

    <h3>Bioplastics (Polyhydroxyalkanoates)</h3>
        <p>In the abundance of carbon sources, some microbes can capture and store nutrients for later use (Anderson and Dawes, 1990). One compound that is often stored is PHA, or polyhydroxyalkanoate. PHAs are lipids that can be processed into monomers, then polymers, and then stored as water insolcule granules in the cytoplasm. PHA has properties similar to polypropylene, meaning it may serve as a substitute for nonbiodegradable plastics (Doi, 1990). PHA is biodegradable and can be entirely mineralized back into water and CO2 in the presence of microbes. Therefore, PHA-producing cyanobacteria may serve as a promising substitute for nonbiodegradable plastics currently used.</p>
