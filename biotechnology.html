            <p>Cyanobacteria are considered a source of bioactive compounds that could serve many eco-friendly purposes. Abed et al., 2008, review the many potential uses. Read on to find out!</p>
    </center>

    <h3>Bioremediation</h3>
        <p>Cyanobacteria are capable of removing pollutants from the environment and degrading them, and thus have been used in bioremediation efforts. With the help of aerobic oligotrophs, cyanobacteria can degrade oil components, surfactants, and herbicides (Yan et al., 1998; Radwan and Al-Hasan, 2000; Raghukmar et al., 2001; Mansy and El-Bestway, 2002). Cyanobacteria guide the aerobic oligotrophs in degradation by providing oxygen needed to break down aromatic rings, simple organics, and fixed nitrogen, allowing them to successfully break down pollutants (Abed and Köster, 2005). Cyanobacteria are also useful for treating wastewater by decreasing calcium, chloride, phenol, and melanoidin, creating treated water suitable for the survival of fish and other organisms (Uma and Subramanian, 1990). </p>  

    <h3>Energy Sources</h3>
        <p>To replace fossil fuel use, cyanobacteria have been harnessed for their ability to produce hydrogen gas as an energy source (Dutta et al., 2005). Hydrogen is produced typically as a byproduct of nitrogen fixation or growth under nitrogen limited conditions. Over 14 genera of cyanobacteria are known to produce hydrogen gas in several culture conditions (Lambert and Smith, 1977; Sveshnikov et al., 1997; Masukawa et al., 2001). Photobioreactor use has been attempted to harness the hydrogen gas produced by cyanobacteria and has proven to bring down the cost of biologically produced hydrogen (Dutta et al., 2005).  </p>

    <h3>Biofertilizers</h3>
        <p>With the ability of heterocystous cyanobacteria to fix atmospheric nitrogen (Capone et al., 2005), fertility of soils can be improved upon inoculating with cyanobacteria (Watanabe and Cholitkul, 1979). Nitrogen would be added in an organic form rather than through the use of chemical soil fertilizers that are inefficient and runoff into the environment. Cyanobacteria biofertilizer has been shown to increase nitrogen inputs and crop yield (Abed et al., 2008).  </p>

    <h3>Bioplastics (Polyhydroxyalkanoates)</h3>
        <p>In the abundance of carbon sources, some microbes can capture and store nutrients for later use (Anderson and Dawes, 1990). One compound that is often stored is PHA, or polyhydroxyalkanoate. PHAs are lipids that can be processed into monomers, then polymers, and then stored as water insolcule granules in the cytoplasm. PHA has properties similar to polypropylene, meaning it may serve as a substitute for nonbiodegradable plastics (Doi, 1992). PHA is biodegradable and can be entirely mineralized back into water and CO2 in the presence of microbes. Therefore, PHA-producing cyanobacteria may serve as a promising substitute for nonbiodegradable plastics currently used.</p>
