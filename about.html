        <h3> Description</h3>
            <p>Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes found in well-lit aquatic and terrestiral environments. They are responsible for the evolution of oxygen on Earth, also known as the "Great Oxidation Event," due to their use of water as an electron donor during photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria synthesize chlorphyll a, a green pigment, and most others also produce a pigment called phycocynanin which presents as a blue color. This is why cyanobacteria are frequently referred to as "blue-green."</p>  
            <p>Quantitatively speaking, cyanobacteria are essentially the most important organisms on Earth, giving rise to about 3 x 10^4 grams of carbon globally.</p>  

        <h3>Habitat</h3>
            <p>Cyanobacteria are known to inhabit freshwater, saltwater, and soil habitats. Their abilty to withstand elevated temperatures allows them to thrive in a wide variety of environments. They can tolerate desiccation and UV exposure. </p>

        <h3>Nitrogen Fixation</h3>
            <p>A crucial role that cyanobacteria possess is the abilty to fix N2 into usual forms of nitrogen. Nitrogen fixation occurs in the heterocysts of freshwater and terrestial species. TALK MORE ABOUT THIS AND DISUCSS HOW THEY BENEFIT FROM FIXING N AND THE MOLCULAR PROCESS  </p>
        
        <h3>Toxin Production</h3>
            <p>Under certain conditions, cyanobacteria produce toxic metabolites. The benefit to producing toxins is... (See also: cHAB tab)</p>
