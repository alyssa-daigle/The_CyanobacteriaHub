                <p>If you've ever been curious about cyanobacteria, formerly known as "blue-green algae", then you've come to the right place! 
                <br>
                <br>
                On this website, you can find <strong> general information </strong> about cyanobacteria, as well as their <strong>diversification/phylogenetic 
                history</strong> and their  <strong>role in the environment. </strong> You can also read about  <strong>harmful cyanobacteria blooms </strong> and how they affect 
                the environment. Additionally, case studies are provided outling the use of cyanobacteria in <strong>biotechnology</strong>. Lastly, a  <strong>photo gallery </strong> is featured on this website to demonstrate the beauty within these mighty microbes!
